CSV tools
========
A set of python scripts I use to edit, sort, split etc of Comma-separated values files. This scripts uses ; to as a split sign. 

The python scripts are standalone executables.

- exclude.py : exclude rows from file1 witch is not contained in file 2.
- mergetwofirst.py : merge first and second column
- firstbigchar.py : converts big chars only to small ones with big at start



Work to be done:

- implement parser and make one command for all the scripts.
- dash option for chosing split char (or automatic detection).
- make it posible to read column with "quotation marks".
